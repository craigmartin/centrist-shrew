### Formatting
* Use ASCII (or UTF-8, not optimal)
* Use 2 space indent, no tabs
* Use Unix-style line endings
* Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons, and semicolons, around { and before }
* No spaces after (, [ and before ], )
* Use two spaces before statement modifiers (postfix if/unless/while/until/resque)
* Indent when as deep as case
* Use an empty line before the return value of a method (unless it only has one line), and an empty line between defs
* Use RDoc and its conventions for API documentation. Don't put an empty line between the comment black and the def.
* Use empty lines to break up a long method into logical paragraphs
* Keep lines fewer than 80 characters
* Avoid trailing whitespace

### Syntax


### Naming


### Comments
* Comment that are longer than one word should be capitalized and written using English rules
